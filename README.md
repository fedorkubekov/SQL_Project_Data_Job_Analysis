# Introduction
This SQL project involves a comprehensive analysis of the job market for data analyst roles. By querying and analyzing various datasets, the project aims to uncover key insights into job titles, companies, salaries, and essential skills required for these roles. The analysis is based on data from great single database with data about job postings, companies and skills. This project demonstrates the power of SQL in extracting, manipulating, and analyzing data to drive informed decisions and provide actionable insights.

You can check my SQL queries for this project here: [projet_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background
Before making this project I have studied the entire course on SQL by Luke Barousse. As first, I studied common used commands in SQL, solving problems in SQLiteviz straight on browser. Than as I progressed at my SQL skills to solve basic problems, I moved to the advanced section of course. After learning and solving problems which were based on using commands more complex commands like CTEs, subqueries, CASE and UNION. After completing the course I started work on this project.

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
To work on this project I used several key tools:
- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis.
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen database management system for work.
- **Visual Studio Code**: To download database files and to execute queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: To share this project publically.
